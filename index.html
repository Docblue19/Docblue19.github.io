		<h2>Enjoy Airsofting with friends</h2>
	
		<p>
			Indoor and Outdoor Airsoft is a combination of both fields. 
			You can start the day playing outdoors then when it starts getting 
			too hot you can move indoors where it is air conditioned. This way 
			you can enjoy a full day of airsoft  without having to worry about it 
			getting too hot. If you don't mind the temperature outside you can still 
			play outdoors. We want you to be able to enjoy multiple game types without 
			being limited to one play style, this way you will feel like your money was 
			well spent. We also have a store in the indoor field, if you need to get more 
			bbs you don't have to drive anywhere else to get them, we also sell airsoft 
			gear if you are wanting to try some new things. For those who are trying 
			to get into airsoft you can rent and you will get a gun face protection, 
			and free bbs for the day.
